# OODA loop

John Boyd is often known for the so-called ‘OODA’ loop model he developed. This model refers to a decision-making process and to the idea that military victory goes to the side that can complete the cycle from observation to action the fastest. This page is our notes about the OODA loop and notes from the book Science, Strategy and War: The strategic theory of John Boyd. By Frans P.B. Osinga.

## OODA loop: observe, orient, decide, act

The OODA loop is the cycle of observe, orient, decide, act. The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power. Compare it to the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle or Shewhart cycle.

The loop states that decision-making occurs in a recurring cycle of observe–orient–decide–act. An entity (whether an individual or an organization) that can process this cycle quickly, observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent, can thereby "get inside" the opponent's decision cycle and thus gain advantages.

The OODA loop was developed by military strategist John Boyd, to explain how to direct one's energies to defeat an adversary and survive. Boyd emphasized that "the loop" is actually a set of interacting loops that are to be kept in continuous operation during combat. Boyd also indicated that the phase of the battle has an important bearing on the ideal allocation of one's energies. Boyd's views on the OODA loop are much deeper, richer, and more comprehensive than the common interpretation of the "rapid OODA loop" idea.


## OODA loop: the strategic theory

In any conflict all combatants go through repeated cycles of observation, orientation, decision, action. The potentially victorious combatant is the one with the cycles which are consistently quicker than his opponent, including the time required to transition from one cycle to the next.

In order to generate the tempo of operations that we desire, and to best cope with the uncertainty, disorder, and fluidity of combat, command and control must be decentralized.

The aim of a strategist is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation so advantageous that if it does not of itself product the decision, its continuation by a battle is sure to achive this.


## OODA loop for business

The same OODA loop operates in a competitive business landscape, and the same logic applies. 

Decision makers gather information (observe).

Decision makers then form hypotheses about markets, customers, products, activities, and the intentions of competitors (orient).

Decision makers then make decisions, and act on them. 

The cycle is repeated continuously, and favors business agility over raw power. The aggressive and conscious application of the process gives a business advantage over a competitor who is merely reacting to conditions as they occur or has poor awareness of the situation. 


## Three spheres: physical, mental, moral

Boyd used a concept of three spheres of war: the physical, the mental, and the moral dimension, using this idea of to structure his argument and develop three modes of conflict. 

Respectively, these spheres dealt with destruction of the enemy's physical strength (fighting power), disorganization of his mental processes (thinking power), and disintigraion of his moral will to resist (staying power). The forces operating within these spheres did so in synergistic ways, not isolated ways.

Boyd emphasized speed, tempo, variety, surprise, trust, initiative, movement, and his view that the moral and mental dimensions came before technology, superiority in numbers, and massed firepower.


## Process to evolve

An important feature of Boyd's book of air maneuvers was that Boyd did not advocate one maneuver over another, but presented the options available to the pilot and his opponent in relation to each other. He wanted to show people a variety of moves and countermoves, and the logic of its dynamic.

His aim was not to convince people about the validity of this or that doctrine, but instead to create among his audience a way of thinking, a thought process.

The process not only creates the output but also represents the key to evolve the tactics, strategies, goals, unifying themes, etc. that permit us to actively shape and adapt to the unfolding world.


## Quotations by Boyd

"Strategy is a mental tapestry of changing intentions for harmonizing and focusing our efforts as a basis for realizing some aim or purpose in an unfolding and often unforeseen world of many bewildering events and many contending interests."

"The key idea is to emphasize implicit over explicit in order to gain a favorable mismatch in friction and time (i.e, ours lower than any adversary’s) for superiority in shaping and adapting to circumstances."

"Arrange the setting and circumstances so that leaders and subordinates alike are given the opportunity to continuously interact with the external world, and with each other, in order to more quickly make many-sided implicit cross-referencing projections, empathies, correlations, and rejections as well as create the similar images or
impressions, hence a similar implicit orientation, needed to form an organic whole."

### Maneuver-based organizations


Characteristics of maneuver-based organizations:

* Rapidity of decision-making

* Rapidity of action

* Decentralized decision-making

* Significant license to execute


Features of maneuver-based organizations:

* Unit cohesion and common values

* High skill levels and training

* New or adaptive reuse of technology

* Tradecraft


### Adaptive synthesis


Thought experiment:

* Break down complex systems into "building blocks". Adaptively reuse and reconfigure into new systems. Be quicker and more effective at coming up with new solutions.

* Look at things from a number of perspectives. Utilize the tools of analysis and synthesis. Come up with novel approaches that integrate seemingly-unrelated concepts or elements. 


Finding unique solutions via synthesis:

* Synthesis is what happens when you are forced to draw a conclusion from an incomplete data set.

* You have to think and plan in ways that are different. You have to adapt. You have to try things that are not “normal”.

* Develop a non-standard mindset, and keep it churning.


### Trust and how to thrive on chaos


Trust among teammates:

* Trust is an essential trait among teammates.

* Trust is a product of confidence and familiarity. 

* Confidence among colleagues results from demonstrated professional skill. 

* Familiarity results from shared experience and a common professional philosophy. 


Strategy and chaos:

* The strategic roadmap should produce operations and tactics sufficient to design an organization which will truly thrive on chaos.

* The organization must be built to respond in an elegant manner to constant environmental changes.

* The organization must be be designed in a manner which will allow it to take as much advantage of these changes as possible, quickly, while losing as little energy as possible.


## EBFAS organizational climate


"EBFAS" is Boyd’s German acronym from the elements of his organizational climate: Einheit (oneness), Behendigkeit (agility), Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling), Auftragstaktik (task tactic), Schwerpunkt (main point).


### Einheit (oneness)


Einheit: Literally "one-ness" or "unity". Can mean "a military detachment or unit". A common outlook possessed by "a body of officers" represents a unifying theme that can be used to simultaneously encourage subordinate initiative yet realize superior intent. TODO: Create Wikipedia entry.


### Behendigkeit (agility)


Behendigkeit: Literally "agility", nimbleness, quickness, swiftness. Behendigkeit, the way Boyd used it, is the ability to break out of longstanding patterns, even if they have been successful.


### Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling)


[Fingerspitzengefühl](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl): literally "fingertip feeling". Means intuitive flair or instinct, which has been adopted by the English language as a loanword. It describes a great situational awareness, and the ability to respond most appropriately and tactfully. It can also be applied to diplomats, bearers of bad news, sports players, or to describe a superior ability to respond to an escalated situation. 


### Auftragstaktik (task tactic)


[Auftragstaktik](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auftragstaktik): a form of military tactics where the emphasis is on the outcome of a mission rather than the specific means of achieving it. Mission-type tactics have been a central component of military tactics since the 19th century. The term Auftragstaktik was coined by opponents of the development of mission-type tactics. Opponents of the implementation of mission-type tactics were called Normaltaktiker.


### Schwerpunkt (main point)


[Schwerpunkt](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerpunkt): literally "hard, difficult, heavy" point. Usually: center of gravity, focus of main effort, focus and direction. heuristic device (conceptual tool or thinking formula) to make decisions from tactics to strategy about priority. Schwerpunkt has been translated as centre of gravity, crucial, focal point and point of main effort. None of these forms is sufficient to describe the universal importance of the term and the concept of Schwerpunktprinzip. Every unit in the army, from the company to the supreme command, decided on a Schwerpunkt through schwerpunktbildung, as did the support services, which meant that commanders always knew what was most important and why.
